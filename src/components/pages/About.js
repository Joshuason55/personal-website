                            <p className='fade-in'>Hi and welcome to my website! My name is Joshua but most people call me Josh. Originally from Seattle, I'm currently a fourth-year student at UC Santa Barbara, excitedly anticipating graduation this summer and stepping into the professional world.</p>
                            <p>Outside academics, my passions are pretty eclectic. I've spent the majority of my life playing soccer at a high level, which fueled my drive and competitive spirit. I also love to snowboard, wake surf, rock climb, and generally enjoy the outdoors whenever I get the chance. When I am not outside, I usually play video games with my friends with my current favorites being Valorant and League of Legends. I also really enjoy music festivals, with my most recent being Coachella. </p>
                            <p>I'm a firm believer that everything is temporary and the key to personal growth is a willingness to continuously learn and evolve. So here I am, ready and eager to start my professional journey, committed to becoming the best version of myself along the way!</p>
